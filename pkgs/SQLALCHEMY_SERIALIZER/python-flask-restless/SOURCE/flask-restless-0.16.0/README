# Flask-Restless #

## Introduction ##

This is Flask-Restless, a [Flask][1] extension which facilitates the creation
of ReSTful JSON APIs. It is compatible with models which have been defined
using either [SQLAlchemy][sa] or [Flask-SQLAlchemy][fsa].

This document contains some brief instructions concerning installation of
requirements, installation of this extension, configuration and usage of this
extension, and building of documentation.

## Contents ##

This is a partial listing of the contents of this package.

* `LICENSE.AGPL` - one possible copyright license under which this program is
  distributed to you (the GNU Affero General Public License version 3)
* `LICENSE.BSD` - another possible copyright license under which this program
  is distributed to you (the 3-clause BSD License)
* `docs/` - the Sphinx documentation for Flask-Restless
* `examples/` - example applications of Flask-Restless
* `flask_restless/` - the Python package containing the extension
* `README.md` - this file
* `setup.py` - Python setuptools configuration file for packaging this
  extension
* `tests/` - unit tests for Flask-Restless

The `flask_restless` directory is a Python package containing the following
files:

* `helpers.py` - utility functions, mainly for performing introspection on
  SQLAlchemy objects
* `manager.py` - contains the main class which end users will utilize to create
  ReSTful APIs for their database models
* `search.py` - functions and classes which facilitate searching the database
  on requests which require a search
* `views.py` - the view class which implements the ReSTful API

## Installing ##

This application requires [Python][4] version 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3. Python 3.2 is
not supported by Flask and therefore cannot be supported by Flask-Restless.

This application requires the following libraries to be installed:

* [Flask][1] version 0.10 or greater
* [SQLAlchemy][sa] version 0.8 or greater
* [python-dateutil][5] version greater than 2.0
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy][fsa] only if your models are defined using Flask-SQLAlchemy

These requirements are also listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Using `pip`
is probably the easiest way to install these:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or

    pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy python-dateutil sqlalchemy

[5]: http://labix.org/python-dateutil

## Building as a Python egg ##

This package can be built, installed, etc. as a Python egg using the provided
`setup.py` script. For more information, run

    python setup.py --help

## How to use ##

For information on how to use this extension, build the documentation here or
[view it on the Web](http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-restless).

## Testing ##

Running the unit tests requires the [nosetests][n] library. This requirement is
also listed in the `requirements-test.txt` file.

Using `pip` is probably the easiest way to install this:

    pip install -r requirements-test.txt

or

    pip install nose

The Python unit tests are contained in the `tests/` directory (which is a
Python package). To run the test suite, run the command

    python setup.py test

You can also run the unit tests in a less verbose way by doing

    nosetests

[n]: https://nose.readthedocs.org/

### Test coverage ###

You can measure the test coverage by running

    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-html --cover-html-dir=<somedir>

where <somedir> is the name of the directory in which the HTML formatted
coverage report will be written.

Measuring test coverage requires the [coverage.py][cov] package, which can be
installed like this:

    pip install coverage

[cov]: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage

### Testing validation ###

Validation is not provided directly by Flask-Restless, but it does provide a
way for users to indicate exceptions to catch. If you wish to test validation
of SQLAlchemy models with a real external SQLAlchemy validation library,
install the development version of [SAValidation][sav]:

    pip install savalidation

This is only possible on Python 2. The test suite will automatically skip these
tests if `savalidation` is not installed or if you are using Python 3.

[sav]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SAValidation

## Building documentation ##

Flask-Restless requires the following program and supporting library to build
the documentation:

* [Sphinx][6]
* [sphinxcontrib-httpdomain][7], version 1.1.7 or greater

These requirements are also listed in the `requirements-doc.txt` file. Using
`pip` is probably the easiest way to install these:

    pip install -r requirements-doc.txt

or

    pip install sphinx "sphinxcontrib-httpdomain>=1.1.7"

The documentation is written for Sphinx in [reStructuredText][8] files in the
`docs/` directory. Documentation for each class and function is provided in the
docstring in the code.

The documentation uses the Flask Sphinx theme. It is included as a git
submodule of this project, rooted at `docs/_themes`. To get the themes, do

    git submodule update --init

Now to build the documentation, run the command

    python setup.py build_sphinx

in the top-level directory. The output can be viewed in a web browser by
opening `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
