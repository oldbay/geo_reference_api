Format of requests and responses
================================

Requests and responses are all in JSON format, so the mimetype is
:mimetype:`application/json`. Ensure that requests you make that require a body
(:http:method:`patch` and :http:method:`post` requests) have the header
``Content-Type: application/json``; if they do not, the server will respond
with a :http:statuscode:`415`.

Suppose we have the following Flask-SQLAlchemy models (the example works with
pure SQLALchemy just the same)::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

    class Person(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = db.Column(db.Unicode, unique=True)
        birth_date = db.Column(db.Date)
        computers = db.relationship('Computer',
                                    backref=db.backref('owner',
                                                       lazy='dynamic'))

    class Computer(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = db.Column(db.Unicode, unique=True)
        vendor = db.Column(db.Unicode)
        owner_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('person.id'))
        purchase_time = db.Column(db.DateTime)


Also suppose we have registered an API for these models at ``/api/person`` and
``/api/computer``, respectively.

.. note::

   API endpoints do not have trailing slashes. A request to, for example,
   ``/api/person/`` will result in a :http:statuscode:`404` response.

.. note::

   For all requests that would return a list of results, the top-level JSON
   object is a mapping from ``"objects"`` to the list. JSON lists are not sent
   as top-level objects for security reasons. For more information, see `this
   <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/security/#json-security>`_.

.. http:get:: /api/person

   Gets a list of all ``Person`` objects.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "num_results": 8,
        "total_pages": 3,
        "page": 2,
        "objects": [{"id": 1, "name": "Jeffrey", "age": 24}, ...]
      }

.. http:get:: /api/person?q=<searchjson>

   Gets a list of all ``Person`` objects which meet the criteria of the
   specified search. For more information on the format of the value of the
   ``q`` parameter, see :ref:`searchformat`.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
         "num_results": 8,
         "total_pages": 3,
         "page": 2,
         "objects": [{"id": 1, "name": "Jeffrey", "age": 24}, ...]
       }

.. http:get:: /api/person/(int:id)

   Gets a single instance of ``Person`` with the specified ID.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {"id": 1, "name": "Jeffrey", "age": 24}

.. http:get:: /api/person/(int:id)/computers

   Gets a list of all ``Computer`` objects which are owned by the ``Person``
   object with the specified ID.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "num_results": 2,
        "total_pages": 1,
        "page": 1,
        "objects": [{"id": 1, "vendor": "Apple", "name": "MacBook", ...}, ...]
      }

.. http:delete:: /api/person/(int:id)

   Deletes the instance of ``Person`` with the specified ID.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

.. http:delete:: /api/person/(int:id)/computers/(int:id)

   Removes the instance of ``Computer`` with the specified ID from the
   ``computers`` collection of the instance of ``Person`` with the specified
   ID. This is essentially a shortcut to using a
   :http:patch:`/api/person/(int:id)/computers` request with a ``remove``
   parameter in the body of the request.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

.. http:post:: /api/person

   Creates a new person with initial attributes specified as a JSON string in
   the body of the request.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {"name": "Jeffrey", "age": 24}

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age" 24,
        "computers": []
      }

   The server will respond with :http:statuscode:`400` if the request specifies
   a field which does not exist on the model.

   To create a new person which includes a related list of **new** computer
   instances via a one-to-many relationship, a request must take the following
   form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers":
          [
            {"manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"},
            {"manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
          ]
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers":
          [
            {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"},
            {"id": 2, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
          ]
      }

   .. warning::

      The response does not denote that new instances have been created for the
      ``Computer`` models.

   To create a new person which includes a single related **new** computer
   instance (via a one-to-one relationship), a request must take the following
   form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computer": {"manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"}
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "id": 1,
        "computer": {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"}
      }

   .. warning::

      The response does not denote that a new ``Computer`` instance has been
      created.

   To create a new person which includes a related list of **existing**
   computer instances via a one-to-many relationship, a request must take the
   following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [ {"id": 1}, {"id": 2} ]
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers":
          [
            {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"},
            {"id": 2, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
          ]
      }

   To create a new person which includes a single related **existing** computer
   instance (via a one-to-one relationship), a request must take the following
   form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computer": {"id": 1}
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "id": 1,
        "computer": {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"}
      }

.. http:patch:: /api/person
.. http:put:: /api/person

   Sets specified attributes on every instance of ``Person`` which meets the
   search criteria described in the ``q`` parameter.

   The JSON object specified in the body of a :http:method:`patch` request to
   this endpoint may include a mapping from `q` to the parameters for a search,
   as described in :ref:`searchformat`. If no `q` key exists, then all
   instances of the model will be patched.

   :http:put:`/api/person` is an alias for :http:patch:`/api/person`, because
   the latter is more semantically correct but the former is part of the core
   HTTP standard.

   The response will return a JSON object which specifies the number of
   instances in the ``Person`` database which were modified.

   **Sample request**:

   Suppose the database contains exactly three people with the letter "y" in
   his or her name.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {
        "age": 1,
        "q": {"filters": [{"name": "name", "op": "like", "val": "%y%"}]}
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      {"num_modified": 3}

.. http:patch:: /api/person/(int:id)
.. http:put:: /api/person/(int:id)

   Sets specified attributes on the instance of ``Person`` with the specified
   ID number. :http:put:`/api/person/1` is an alias for
   :http:patch:`/api/person/1`, because the latter is more semantically correct
   but the former is part of the core HTTP standard.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      {"name": "Foobar"}

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {"id": 1, "name": "Foobar", "age": 24}

   The server will respond with :http:statuscode:`400` if the request specifies
   a field which does not exist on the model.

   To add a list of existing objects to a one-to-many relationship, a request
   must take the following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
        {
          "add": [ {"id": 1} ]
        }
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [ {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"} ]
      }

   To add a list of new objects to a one-to-many relationship, a request must
   take the following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
        {
          "add": [ {"manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"} ]
        }
      }

   .. warning::

      The response does not denote that a new instance has been created for the
      ``Computer`` model.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [ {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"} ]
      }

   Similarly, to add a new or existing instance of a related model to a
   one-to-one relationship, a request must take the following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
        {
          "add": {"id": 1}
        }
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [ {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron"} ]
      }

   To remove an existing object (without deleting that object from its own
   database) from a one-to-many relationship, a request must take the following
   form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
        {
          "remove": [ {"id": 2} ]
        }
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [
          {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron 9300"},
          {"id": 3, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
        ]
      }

   To remove an existing object from a one-to-many relationship and
   additionally delete it from its own database, a request must take the
   following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
        {
          "remove": [ {"id": 2, "__delete__": true} ]
        }
      }

   .. warning::

      The response does not denote that the instance was deleted from its own
      database.

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [
          {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron 9300"},
          {"id": 3, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
        ]
      }

   To set the value of a one-to-many relationship to contain either existing or
   new instances of the related model, a request must take the following form.

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
          [
            {"id": 1},
            {"id": 3},
            {"manufacturer": "Lenovo", "model": "ThinkPad"}
          ]
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [
          {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Dell", "model": "Inspiron 9300"},
          {"id": 3, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
          {"id": 4, "manufacturer": "Lenovo", "model": "ThinkPad"}
        ]
      }

   To set the value of a one-to-many relationship *and* update fields on
   existing instances of the related model, a request must take the following
   form.

   Suppose the ``Person`` instance looked like this before the sample
   :http:method:`patch` request below:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [
          {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Apple", "model": "MacBook"}
        ]
      }

   **Sample request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/person/1 HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

      { "computers":
          [
            {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Lenovo", "model": "ThinkPad"}
          ]
      }

   **Sample response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "age": 24,
        "computers": [
          {"id": 1, "manufacturer": "Lenovo", "model": "ThinkPad"}
        ]
      }

   The changes reflected in this response have been made to the ``Computer``
   instance with ID 1.

Date and time fields
--------------------

Flask-Restless will automatically parse and convert date and time strings into
the corresponding Python objects. Flask-Restless also understands intervals
(also known as durations), if you specify the interval as an integer
representing the number of seconds that the interval spans.

If you want the server to set the value of a date or time field of a model as
the current time (as measured at the server), use one of the special strings
``"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"``, ``"CURRENT_DATE"``, or ``"LOCALTIMESTAMP"``. When the
server receives one of these strings in a request, it will use the
corresponding SQL function to set the date or time of the field in the model.

Errors and error messages
-------------------------

Most errors return :http:statuscode:`400`. A bad request, for example, will
receive a response like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

   {"message": "Unable to decode data"}

If your request triggers a SQLAlchemy :exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.DataError`,
:exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`, or
:exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError`, the session will be rolled back.

.. _functionevaluation:

Function evaluation
-------------------

If the ``allow_functions`` keyword argument is set to ``True`` when creating an
API for a model using :meth:`APIManager.create_api`, then an endpoint will be
made available for :http:get:`/api/eval/person` which responds to requests for
evaluation of functions on *all* instances the model.

**Sample request**:

.. sourcecode:: http

   GET /api/eval/person?q={"functions": [{"name": "sum", "field": "age"}, {"name": "avg", "field": "height"}]} HTTP/1.1

The format of the response is

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   {"sum__age": 100, "avg_height": 68}

If no functions are specified in the request, the response will contain
the empty JSON object, ``{}``.

.. note::

   The functions whose names are given in the request will be evaluated using
   SQLAlchemy's `func
   <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/expression_api.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.func>`_
   object.

.. admonition:: Example

   To get the total number of rows in the query (that is, the number of
   instances of the requested model), use ``count`` as the name of the function
   to evaluate, and ``id`` for the field on which to evaluate it:

   **Request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/eval/person?q={"functions": [{"name": "count", "field": "id"}]} HTTP/1.1

   **Response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      {"count__id": 5}

JSONP callbacks
----------------

Add a ``callback=myfunc`` query parameter to the request URL on any
:http:method:`get` requests (including endpoints for function evaluation) to
have the JSON data of the response wrapped in the Javascript function
``myfunc``. This can be used to circumvent some cross domain scripting security
issues. For example, a request like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

   GET /api/person/1?callback=foo HTTP/1.1

will produce a response like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   foo({"meta": ..., "data": ...})

Then in your Javascript code, write the function ``foo`` like this:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   function foo(response) {
     var meta, data;
     meta = response.meta;
     data = response.data;
     // Do something cool here...
   }

The metadata includes the status code and the values of the HTTP headers,
including the `Link headers <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`_ parsed in
JSON format. For example, a link that looks like this:

.. This is adapted from the GitHub API documentation; see
.. <http://developer.github.com/v3/#json-p-callbacks> for more information.

.. sourcecode:: http

   Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

will look like this in the JSON metadata:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   [
     {"url": "url1", "rel": "next"},
     {"url": "url2", "rel": "foo", "bar": "baz"}
   ]

The mimetype of a JSONP response is ``application/javascript`` instead of the
usual ``application/json``, because the payload of such a response is not valid
JSON.

.. _clientpagination:

Pagination
----------

Responses to :http:method:`get` requests are paginated by default, with at most
ten objects per page. To request a specific page, add a ``page=N`` query
parameter to the request URL, where ``N`` is a positive integer (the first page
is page one). If no ``page`` query parameter is specified, the first page will
be returned.

In order to specify the number of results per page, add the query parameter
``results_per_page=N`` where ``N`` is a positive integer. If
``results_per_page`` is greater than the maximum number of results per page as
configured by the server (see :ref:`serverpagination`), then the query
parameter will be ignored.

In addition to the ``"objects"`` list, the response JSON object will have a
``"page"`` key whose value is the current page, a ``"num_pages"`` key whose
value is the total number of pages into which the set of matching instances is
divided, and a ``"num_results"`` key whose value is the total number of
instances which match the requested search. For example, a request to
:http:get:`/api/person?page=2` will result in the following response:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   {
     "num_results": 8,
     "page": 2,
     "num_pages": 3,
     "objects": [{"id": 1, "name": "Jeffrey", "age": 24}, ...]
   }

If pagination is disabled (by setting ``results_per_page=None`` in
:meth:`APIManager.create_api`, for example), any ``page`` key in the query
parameters will be ignored, and the response JSON will include a ``"page"`` key
which always has the value ``1``.

.. note::

   As specified in in :ref:`queryformat`, clients can receive responses with
   ``limit`` (a maximum number of objects in the response) and ``offset`` (the
   number of initial objects to skip in the response) applied. It is possible,
   though not recommended, to use pagination in addition to ``limit`` and
   ``offset``. For simple clients, pagination should be fine.
